0,Candice McMillan,"The writing never stalls in one scene for very long, allowing Black enough time to garner laughs before moving on to the next ridiculous hijinks. Kung Fu Panda 4 understands the task and knocks it out of the ancient temple.",Positive
1,Katie Walsh,This dumpling is a little too light on the filling.,Positive
2,Mat Brunet,"In a way, it’s like if Kung Fu Panda lost a bit of its soul and it was reduced to a popcorn flick. That’s not a bad thing and you can still have fun with it. It’s just that you won’t get that lost-lasting impact that the previous three had.",Positive
3,Steven Prokopy,"Mostly, KFP4 feels like a safe step forward, and if Dreamworks Animation decides to make more of these, I hope they keep Zhen and strive a little harder to make the screenplay something better than this cut-and-paste action-adventure movie.",Positive
4,Lauren Veneziani,"Jack Black, Awkwafina and Viola Davis give stellar voice performances in this sequel that continues Po's story and fun for adults and kids. ",Positive
5,Jana Monji,"The story is American comfort food with wuxi flavoring, but this installment in the Kung Fu Panda cinematic universe suggests a new direction that could feature people of East Asian descent more prominently. The animation on the villain is exceptional.",Positive
6,M.N. Miller,Kung Fu Panda 4 is not worth watching because it borrows too many elements from previous films (and others in the DreamWorks filmography) that stunt any potential creativity to be a proper standalone entry in the franchise. ,Positive
7,Aglaia Berlutti,"""Kung Fu Panda 4"" forgets its central characters in favor of new ones. This turns the adventure into a scenario that loses the charm of the previous installments. [Full Review in Spanish]",Negative
8,Chris Sawin,"Kung Fu Panda 4 isn’t the best Kung Fu Panda film, or even the best of the series’ three sequels. However, as a fourth film in a franchise, it’s a ton of fun.",Negative
9,Collin Garbarino,"The trope of having the old hero pass the mantle off to a young girl is wearing pretty thin with me. But that said, it’s still an entertaining movie and will certainly please fans of the franchise.",Negative
10,Laura Hiros,"It is important to say goodbye and address that changes are good, and it's our responsibility to accept them. However, for most of the mortals, what will really make them think is that it's time for Po to sadly pass the baton. [Full Review in Spanish]",Positive
11,Martin Unsworth,"An underwritten side quest with main adventure stakes, Kung Fu Panda 4 is far and away the weakest entry in the franchise. ",Positive
12,Alci Rengifo,"As with the previous three, this “Kung Fu Panda” still offers fine lessons in moving forward and self-esteem. That makes it just likable enough.",Positive
13,Abbie Bernstein,An action-packed animated sequel.,Positive
14,Sara Michelle Fetters,This is an enjoyably winning continuation of Po’s story.,Positive
15,Doug Walker,"While nowhere near as deep or epic as the previous installments, there is just enough comedy and heart to make this a passable family film.",Negative
16,Sarah Gopaul,"Even though some of the key characters are new, this is still very much a 'Kung Fu Panda' movie, meaning it’s sweet and amusing",Positive
17,Korey Coleman,"Kung Fu Panda 4 takes some really creative steps with characters, making little details and visual gags with the designs. The movie falls short storywise, but everything else shows a lot of effort.",Positive
18,Jeffrey Harris,"Kung Fu Panda 4 doesn't quite reach the previous heights of the franchise, but it still provides a fun, entertaining, and exciting adventure for Po as he seeks to come to terms with the next steps in his life.",Positive
19,Michael Ward,"Amusing in fits and starts, a lot of the jokes and gags feel like recycled bits we have seen before or they largely miss the mark completely. ",Positive
